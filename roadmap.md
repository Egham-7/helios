# Helios MVP Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Basic Functionality (1-2 months)

* Design and implement Go Proxy

  * Basic request routing by model ID
  * Cache Accelerate memory profiles
  * Kubernetes integration for querying workers
* Develop Model Registry (Go)

  * Content-addressable model caching
  * Metadata & versioning support
* Build vLLM Worker (Python)

  * Basic prefill and decode workers
  * Simple batching and token streaming
* Implement basic Zig Storage Layer

  * Async file IO and model loading
  * Single-tier local NVMe caching
* Deploy initial Kubernetes cluster with GPU nodes
* Create minimal API endpoints (inference, models, health)
* Set up basic logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: Warm Pool & Dynamic Scaling (1 month)

* Add warm pool management in Proxy and Registry
* Enable circuit breaking and retry logic in Proxy
* Integrate Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for prefill/decode pools
* Implement GPU bin-packing aware scheduling (basic affinity/anti-affinity)
* Extend Storage Layer for multi-tier caching (add SSD tier)
* Improve vLLM batching with dynamic batch size and timeout
* Add Prometheus metrics collection and dashboards

### Phase 3: Advanced Performance Optimizations (1-2 months)

* Implement zero-copy safetensors memory-mapped model loading in Zig
* Support mixed-precision inference and INT8 quantization in vLLM workers
* Enable multi-GPU model parallelism and pipeline parallelism
* Integrate CUDA Graph warm-up and fused kernels in inference pipeline
* Implement KV cache spill/prefetch between GPU RAM, host RAM, NVMe tiers
* Add predictive prefetching and size-aware eviction in Model Registry
* Enhance Kubernetes scheduling with GPU MIG awareness and gang scheduling

### Phase 4: Resilience, Observability & Security (1 month)

* Add distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) across components
* Implement advanced circuit breakers and load shedding
* Add detailed request latency, throughput, and error metrics
* Integrate service mesh for mTLS and secure service-to-service communication
* Implement admin endpoints for manual scaling, cache eviction, and health checks
* Develop alerting on resource exhaustion, slow responses, and errors

### Phase 5: Scalability & Production Readiness (1+ months)

* Implement cluster autoscaler integration for GPU node scaling
* Support multi-region deployment with edge caching
* Perform load testing to validate throughput and latency targets
* Optimize cold start times with model prewarming strategies
* Establish backup, disaster recovery, and zero-downtime deployment workflows
* Conduct security audits and compliance validations
