## Multi-Tier Loading System

### Storage Hierarchy (Production)

**4-Tier Architecture for 6-8x Cold Start Improvement**

```
Tier 1: GPU Memory (4TB)     â†’ Instant Access (<100ms)
Tier 2: NVMe SSD (64TB)      â†’ Fast Access (<2s)
Tier 3: SATA SSD (192TB)     â†’ Warm Access (<8s)
Tier 4: Multi-Cloud Storage  â†’ Progressive Loading (<15s)
```

### Loading Strategy Selection

**Automatic Tier Detection**:
1. **Check GPU Memory**: If model cached â†’ Instant start
2. **Check NVMe SSD**: If model present â†’ 2s cold start
3. **Check SATA SSD**: If model available â†’ 8s cold start
4. **Fallback to Cloud**: Progressive streaming download

### Progressive Loading Process

**Streaming Optimization**:
- **Layer-by-layer loading**: Start inference while downloading remaining layers
- **Parallel streaming**: 16 concurrent streams from multi-cloud storage
- **Compression**: Safetensors format reduces download size by 15-25%
- **Prefetching**: ML-based prediction pre-loads likely-needed models

### Memory Management

**Intelligent Caching**:
- **LRU Eviction**: Least recently used models moved to lower tiers
- **Predictive Promotion**: Usage patterns promote models to faster tiers
- **Cross-GPU Pooling**: Virtual memory spans multiple GPU devices
- **Defragmentation**: Automatic memory optimization during idle periods

### Cache Promotion Rules

**Tier Movement Logic**:
- **GPU â†’ NVMe**: When GPU memory needed for higher priority model
- **NVMe â†’ GPU**: For frequently accessed models (>5 requests/hour)
- **SATA â†’ NVMe**: When NVMe has available space and model shows usage
- **Cloud â†’ SATA**: Automatic caching of all downloaded models
