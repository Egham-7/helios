# ðŸš€ Serverless LLM Inference Architecture

## MVP vs Production Overview

### MVP (Weeks 1-6)
Basic working system with single cloud deployment, simple routing, and minimal observability.

### Production (Weeks 7-24)  
High-performance, cost-optimized, multi-cloud system with 6-8x cold start improvement, 24x throughput gains, and 54% cost reduction.

## Multi-Tier Loading System

### Storage Hierarchy (6-8x Cold Start Improvement)

```
Tier 1: GPU Memory (4TB)     â†’ Instant Access (<100ms)
Tier 2: NVMe SSD (64TB)      â†’ Fast Access (<2s)
Tier 3: SATA SSD (192TB)     â†’ Warm Access (<8s)
Tier 4: Multi-Cloud Storage  â†’ Progressive Loading (<15s)
```

**Loading Strategy**: Automatic tier detection with progressive streaming, layer-by-layer loading, and intelligent caching with LRU eviction and predictive promotion.
